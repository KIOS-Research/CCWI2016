# A new feature for epanet.m
I would like to add Pressur-Driven-Demand (PDD) analysis to the epanet.m. The PDD analysis is necessary when the pressurs of nodes in the Water Distribution Network (WDN) are insufficient.

There are 3 types of approaches to solve the PDD analysis model, and the method proposed by Paez et al.(2018 b) is used in this project, which is tested in BPDRR (Paze et al.2018 a)

## How to install necessary compilers 

In order to use the EPANET-MATLAB-Toolkit the <b> MinGW-w64 compiler </b> must be installed: <p>

In case you have a version of matlab older than 2015b install the <b> Windows SDK compiler</b>: <p>

## How to fix/report bugs

To fix a bug `Fork` the `EPANET-Matlab Toolkit`, `Edit` the code and make the appropriate change, and then `Pull` it so that we evaluate it. 

Keep in mind that some bugs may exist in the `EPANET` libraries, in case you are not receiving the expected results.
